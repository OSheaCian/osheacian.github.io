🧑 I'm a Teaching Fellow in Economics at Trinity College Dublin, and hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Limerick.

📜 My research interests focus on the interactions between the public and private sectors to provide public services.

📚 My teaching interests involve a variety of subjects from the economics of the public sector to economic maths, statistics and econometrics.

# Selected Experience

## 🔬 Research Experience

I have extensive experience in conducting independent research using both qualitative and quantitative methods. I am currently a member of the P4 (Privatisation and Public-Private Partnerships) Research Cluster at the Kemmy Business School, University of Limerick, where I research the governance and performance of Ireland's Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Sector.

I currently have three peer reviewed works (with another currently under review 🤞) from my PhD thesis. My current work focuses on the hazards of contracting, and on the impact of contractor failure on public sector projects. I have also served as peer reviewer in both economics and public administration.

## 🎓 Teaching Experience

I am an experienced higher education teacher with over seven years experience teaching economics at university level. I have taught a variety of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in econometrics, statistics, public finance, and mirco & macro economics. 

To accompany this I have developed videos, inforgraphics, and other material to assist students in learning basic programming, statistics, and mathematical concepts.
